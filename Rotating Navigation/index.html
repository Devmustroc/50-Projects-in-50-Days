        <p>The Barbary lion, once widespread in North Africa, is now extinct in the wild due to hunting, habitat loss, and human encroachment.
            The last recorded sighting of a wild Barbary lion was in Morocco in the 1920s. Conservation efforts have been ongoing, including the
            establishment of protected areas and attempts to reintroduce captive-bred lions into the wild. However, the lack of genetic diversity
            poses a challenge to these efforts. The Barbary lion is an important part of Morocco's history and heritage,
            and there is a growing interest in preserving this iconic species through education and awareness programs and eco-tourism promotion..</p>

        <h3>Morocco And Barbary Lion</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061750202878414879/1081656642665455656/Mustrovski_Barbary_lion_SittingAtlas_Mountain_OuarzazateKasbahN_3a8c2119-3107-4a3f-a559-2ff6a6d9e1bb.png" alt="lion" />
        <p>The Barbary lion was once a symbol of power and royalty in Morocco, and it holds cultural significance in the country's history.
            The animal's large size and distinctive black mane make it a majestic creature, but its population was decimated by hunting and human activities.
            Despite the challenges facing its conservation, there is hope that continued research and efforts can bring
            the Barbary lion back from the brink of extinction and restore it to its former glory in the mountains of Morocco.</p>
